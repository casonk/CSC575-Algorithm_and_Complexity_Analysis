abstract = {Quasi-cliques are dense incomplete subgraphs of a graph that generalize the notion of cliques. Enumerating quasi-cliques from a graph is a robust way to detect densely connected structures with applications in bioinformatics and social network analysis. However, enumerating quasi-cliques in a graph is a challenging problem, even harder than the problem of enumerating cliques. We consider the enumeration of top-k degree-based quasi-cliques and make the following contributions: (1)&nbsp;we show that even the problem of detecting whether a given quasi-clique is maximal (i.e., not contained within another quasi-clique) is NP-hard. (2)&nbsp;We present a novel heuristic algorithm KernelQC to enumerate the k largest quasi-cliques in a graph. Our method is based on identifying kernels of extremely dense subgraphs within a graph, followed by growing subgraphs around these kernels, to arrive at quasi-cliques with the required densities. (3)&nbsp;Experimental results show that our algorithm accurately enumerates quasi-cliques from a graph, is much faster than current state-of-the-art methods for quasi-clique enumeration (often more than three orders of magnitude faster), and can scale to larger graphs than current methods.},
